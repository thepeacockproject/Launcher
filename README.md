# Launcher

This is the launcher for [The Peacock Project](https://thepeacockproject.org/).

## Installation

- This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.
- You will also need to enable corepack after installing Node.js, which can be done with:
```sh
corepack enable
```
- Next, you will also need to install Rust (which is what the launcher backend uses). For convinence, you can grab the Windows installer [here](https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-1.64.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.msi).
- Finally, install the frontend dependencies with:
```sh
yarn install
```

## Running

To start the app in development mode, run:

```sh
yarn start
```
